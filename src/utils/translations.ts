            q1: "Is this guaranteed profit?",
            a1: "Our In-house Hybrid-Model is mathematically designed to beat the sportsbooks. It means placing bets where the probability of winning is higher than the implied probability of the odds offered. Over time, this mathematical edge guarantees profit, similar to being the house in a casino.",
            q2: "How much bankroll do I need to start?",
            a2: "You don't need a huge bankroll. It is easy to grow a bankroll with a small amount by strictly following the system, although it will take a bit longer to generate substantial profits compared to a larger starting balance.",
            q3: "Do I need to know sports to win?",
            a3: "Absolutely not. In fact, knowing sports can sometimes hurt you if you rely on 'gut feelings'. Our system is 100% data-driven. You are following math, not teams. We tell you exactly what to bet, when, and how much.",
            q4: "How do I receive the picks?",
            a4: "All picks are delivered instantly via our private Discord server. You can enable push notifications to ensure you never miss a +EV opportunity. Speed is key, and Discord is the fastest delivery method available.",
            q5: "Is there a guarantee?",
            a5: "Yes. We offer the industry's strongest guarantee. If you don't profit in your first week, you get 30 days free. If you don't profit in your first month, you get a full refund. We are that confident in our math.",
            q6: "Can I cancel my subscription anytime?",
            a6: "Yes, you can cancel anytime through our Whop page. If there are any complications, please contact support and we will get the issue rectified right away.",
            q7: "Which sportsbooks do I need?",
            a7: "The more options you have, the better your edge will be. However, you can absolutely still profit with just one sportsbook. Don't let that stop you from getting started.",
            q8: "Is this legal?",
            a8: "Yes, sports betting is legal in many jurisdictions. However, it is your responsibility to ensure you are complying with the local laws and regulations of your specific location.",

            q2: "De combien de bankroll ai-je besoin pour commencer ?",
            a2: "Vous n'avez pas besoin d'une grosse bankroll. Il est facile de faire croître un petit capital en suivant strictement le système, même si cela prendra un peu plus de temps pour générer des profits substantiels.",
            q3: "Dois-je connaître le sport pour gagner ?",
            a3: "Absolument pas. En fait, connaître le sport peut parfois vous nuire si vous vous fiez à votre instinct. Notre système est 100 % basé sur les données. Vous suivez les mathématiques, pas les équipes. Nous vous disons exactement quoi parier, quand et combien.",

            q5: "Y a-t-il une garantie ?",
            a5: "Oui. Nous offrons la garantie la plus solide de l'industrie. Si vous ne faites pas de profit la première semaine, vous obtenez 30 jours gratuits. Si vous ne faites pas de profit le premier mois, vous obtenez un remboursement complet. Nous sommes aussi confiants que ça.",
            q6: "Puis-je annuler mon abonnement à tout moment ?",

            q7: "De quels bookmakers ai-je besoin ?",

            q8: "Is this legal?",
